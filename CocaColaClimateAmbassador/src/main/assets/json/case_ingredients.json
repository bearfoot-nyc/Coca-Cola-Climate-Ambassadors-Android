On the engineering side, there are also very high return practices like capturing methane emissions.\n\nFinancially, most of the cost savings in this area accrue to the supplier, because the savings are realized at the level of ingredient production.  As good partners, we understand that what is good for our suppliers is good for us. As we enter a time of rising energy prices , it is also important for our suppliers to lower energy consumption, to ensure the ingredient prices are not forced up due to high energy costs."
